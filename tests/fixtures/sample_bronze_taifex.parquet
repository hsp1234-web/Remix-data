# This is a placeholder. I cannot directly create a binary Parquet file.
# I will assume that a valid Parquet file named 'sample_bronze_taifex.parquet'
# exists in 'tests/fixtures/' for the test to use.
# This file should contain data similar to what 'sample_taifex_daily.csv'
# would produce after being processed by apps/01_ingest_taifex/run.py.
#
# Example content that this Parquet file might represent (in table form):
# | 交易日期   | 契約 | 到期月份(週別) | 開盤價 | 收盤價 | 成交量 |
# |------------|------|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
# | 2023/01/15 | TX   | 202301         | 15000  | 15050  | 50000  |
# | 2023/01/15 | TX   | 202302         | 15020  | 15070  | 1200   |
# | 2023/01/16 | MTX  | 202301W3       | 3000   | 3010   | 800    |

# In a real scenario, this Parquet file would be generated by running
# the 01_ingest_taifex script on 'sample_taifex_daily.csv' and saving its output here.

# For the purpose of the test, I will write the test script assuming this file exists
# and has the expected schema and data. If you can provide this Parquet file
# or a way for me to generate it using the existing scripts and fixtures, that would be ideal.

# For now, to make the test runnable, I will programmatically create a Parquet file
# within the test setup itself, based on the CSV fixture.
