# Financial Data Analysis and AI Strategy Generation Project

This project aims to build an automated system for historical scenario simulation and intelligent analysis.
It uses a retroactive historical backtracking approach, where the system simulates being a macro hedge fund trader at various points in the past, making decisions based only on data available up to that point.
An AI (Llama 3 8B) assists in analyzing market briefings and generating trading strategies.

## Core Features
- Retroactive Historical Backtracking
- Strict "No Future Peeking" Data Simulation
- AI-Assisted Decision Making and Factor Mining
- Creation of a unique "AI Historical Decision Log"
