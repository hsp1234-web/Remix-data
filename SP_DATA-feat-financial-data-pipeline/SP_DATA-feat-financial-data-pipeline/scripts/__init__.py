# This file can make 'scripts' importable as a package,
# though typically scripts are run directly.
# Useful if there are utility functions within 'scripts' that other parts of the project might import.

# print("scripts/__init__.py executed") # For debugging
# import logging
# logging.getLogger(__name__).debug("scripts package initialized (if treated as such)")
