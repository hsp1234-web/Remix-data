# This file can make 'configs' importable as a package.
# Generally not needed if configs are just read as YAML/JSON files,
# but doesn't hurt to have for consistency or future use if Python modules are added here.

# print("configs/__init__.py executed") # For debugging
# import logging
# logging.getLogger(__name__).debug("configs package initialized (if treated as such)")
